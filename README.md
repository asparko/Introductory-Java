# Introductory-Java
Coding assignments from COMP 401 at UNC, Spring 2014

Assignment 1: No object-oriented programming. Counts the number of a user-inputted sequence in a given DNA strand.
*Strings, functions, variables*
<br>

Assignment 2: Similar to Assignment 1, but utilizing OO programming.
*Classes, strings, methods*
<br>

Assignment 3: Create Pixel and Frame interfaces, and then create objects which implement these interfaces. Create getter and setter methods. Create two iterators over pixels in a frame--one which goes row by row, and one which zig-zags diagonally through a pixel array. *Objects, interfaces, collections, iterators*
<br>

Assignment 4: Builds on Assignment 3. Compares pixel frames. Separates RGB Color frame into three frames, one with the R pixel values, one with the B pixel values, and one with the G pixel values. *Overriding and overloading methods, inheritance hierarchies, abstract parent classes*
<br>

Assignment 5: Builds on Assignment 4. Get and set pixels in a frame to new values. Creates cropped copies of partial frames. Creates mosaic tiles of partial frames. *Refactoring, copy vs. deep copy*
<br>

Assignment 6: Builds on Assignment 5. Observers can register an area of interest for a certain frame and receive notifications when pixels in that area change. *Observer/observable design pattern, decorator design pattern*
<br>

Assignment 7: Continues building on Assignment 6. Create a mini UI-widget where users can interact with an image (a frame of pixels). *User-interaction, Java image libraries*

Assignment 8: Builds on Assignment 7. Model-View-Controller UI widget to edit images. *User-interaction, MVC design pattern*
